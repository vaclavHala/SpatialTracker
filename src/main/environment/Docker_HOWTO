-- Redmine via Docker HOWTO --
    Before running the Spatial Tracker itself environment needs to be set up
    For running tests:
        Docker daemon needs to run and listen on TCP port 2375
        how to do this - https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube#preliminaries
        put DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
        into /etc/default/docker
    
    For running the application:
        Redmine and Postgres docker containers need to be built and started
        Custom Dockerfiles for each are in environment/postgres and environment/redmine

cd environment/postgres && sudo docker build -t pg-red .
cd environment/redmine && sudo docker build -t red .

    then run the containers (from any directory)

sudo docker run --name pg-red -d pg-red
sudo docker run --name red --link pg-red:postgres -p 3000:3000 -d red

    if any name clashes occured either when creating images or running containers
    just use different names (in place of pg-red, red), all will work the same

go to http://localhost:3000/settings in browser, if all is well login screen appears
    login:pass
    admin:admin
log in as admin, go to My Account, click Show API Access Key in right column
    api_key:264acfed33b8af628991dda4de64d75390854d82
if the api key displayed matches the one above environment is ready

Other:

    for looking at redmine log
sudo docker exec -ti red bash
tail -f log/production.log (in new shell opened by above command)

    for logging jax rs http messages, in wildfly standalone.xml
<logger category="org.apache.http.wire">
    <level name="DEBUG"/>
</logger>

    To enable docker operation without needing root, put
DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    into /etc/default/docker
    then include -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 in every command, will work without root
    or define alias for the session
alias dockertcp='docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375'
    might not work in bash, ok in zsh
